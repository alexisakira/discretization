function [x, w] = GaussHermite(n)

% This function determines the abscisas (x) and weights (w) for the
% Gauss-Hermite quadrature of order n>1, on the interval [-INF, +INF].
    % This function is valid for any degree n>=2, as the companion matrix
    % (of the n'th degree Hermite polynomial) is constructed as a
    % symmetrical matrix, guaranteeing that all the eigenvalues (roots)
    % will be real.

% Building the companion matrix CM
    % CM is such that det(xI-CM)=L_n(x), with L_n the Hermite polynomial
    % under consideration. Moreover, CM will be constructed in such a way
    % that it is symmetrical.

% Determining the abscissas (x) and weights (w)
    % - since det(xI-CM)=L_n(x), the abscissas are the roots of the
    %   characteristic polynomial, i.d. the eigenvalues of CM;
    % - the weights can be derived from the corresponding eigenvectors.
